# 1️⃣ Introduction

**PixelForum** is a web application designed as an interactive forum for video game enthusiasts 🎮.  
Its architecture follows a **Single Page Application (SPA)** model , where the client-side interface is dynamically rendered by the browser while the backend provides data through API REST.  

The system is divided into three main layers:  
- 🖥️ **Client (Frontend):** Developed with **Angular**, responsible for the graphical interface and routing without page reloads.  
- 🧠 **Server (Backend):** Implemented with **Spring Boot**, which exposes a REST API that handles business logic, user authentication (JWT), and communication with the database. 
- 🗄️ **Database:** A **MySQL** relational database that stores users, forum posts, comments, and related data.  

Deployment is containerized with **Docker 🐳** and orchestrated using **Docker Compose**, allowing the system’s components to run as isolated services.  
Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are configured through **GitHub Actions**, automating build, testing, and deployment processes.

# 4️⃣ Architecture

## Deployment Architecture

The application follows a **microservices-inspired deployment architecture**, with independent processes for the backend, frontend, and database:
- 🖥️ **Frontend (Angular)** — Runs as a separate process, served via **Node.js**, consuming the backend REST API.
- 🧠 **Backend (Spring Boot)** — Runs as an independent process exposing REST endpoints over **HTTPS**.
- 🗄️ **Database (MySQL)** — Runs as an independent process, accessed by the backend via the **JDBC protocol**.

All services communicate using standard protocols: the frontend and backend interact via **REST over HTTPS** (backend on port **8443**, frontend on port **4200**), while the backend connects to the database using **TCP/IP** (MySQL on port **3306**).

## API REST

The REST API documentation is automatically generated using **springdoc-openapi** and made available via Swagger UI.  
An HTML version is hosted using [raw.githack.com](https://raw.githack.com), providing a live view of the API specification, here:
 🌐 [Api-docs.html](https://rawcdn.githack.com/codeurjc-students/2025-PixelForum/65f151c814cd4a7f095f490b6a65a9393d05e418/docs/api/api-docs.html)

# 5️⃣ Quality Control

This section describes the quality assurance strategy applied to **PixelForum**, including automated tests on both backend and frontend, system-level tests, API validation, and static code analysis using **SonarQube**.  
The goal of these quality controls is to ensure reliability, security, maintainability, and functional correctness across all components of the SPA + REST API architecture.

## Server tests (Backend)
The backend (Spring Boot) includes automated tests that validate business logic, data access, and API behavior.

### ✔️ Types of backend tests
- **Unit tests (JUnit 5 + Mockito):** Validate isolated service logic and utility classes without loading the Spring context. Dependencies such as repositories are mocked to ensure that only the business logic is tested in complete isolation.
- **Integration tests (Spring Boot Test):** Validate the interaction between services and repositories within a full Spring application context. These tests run against the real MySQL database used in the development environment, ensuring that persistence operations and service behavior function correctly under realistic conditions.

## Client tests (Frontend)
The frontend (Angular) includes unit and integration tests that validate UI logic and service communication.

### ✔️ Types of client tests
- **Unit tests (Karma + Jasmine):** Validate Angular components and services using Angular’s TestBed with mocked dependencies. These tests verify component logic, service behavior, and simplified DOM interactions in isolation, without relying on external modules or real network calls.
- **Integration tests (Real API integration):** Validate the behavior of frontend services by performing real HTTP requests against the backend API. These tests ensure that the Angular application communicates correctly with the Spring Boot backend, verifying data flow and real network integration.

### 📊 Frontend testing statistics

## System Tests
System tests validate the behavior of the application as a whole, combining the frontend, backend, and data layers under real execution conditions. These tests do not isolate components; instead, they verify the end-to-end functionality from the user perspective or through full backend interactions. Two technologies are used in this project for system testing: Selenium WebDriver for UI-level tests and RestAssured for backend API-level system verification.

## Static Code Analysis (SonarQube)
Static code analysis was performed using SonarQube, a tool that inspects the source code without executing it. SonarQube helps to identify potential bugs, code smells, security vulnerabilities, and maintainability issues, providing an overall quality assessment of the project.

# 6️⃣ Development Process
The development process followed an iterative and incremental approach, adhering to the principles of the Agile manifesto. Some best practices from Extreme Programming (XP) and Kanban were applied to improve code quality, collaboration, and task management. Although Scrum was not formally implemented, the process emphasizes continuous improvement, frequent deliveries, and incremental progress.

The development followed an **iterative and incremental** process inspired by **Agile principles** and **Extreme Programming (XP)** practices, focusing on short development cycles and continuous improvement.  

## 🧠 Task Management
- Tasks tracked through **GitHub Issues**.  
- Visual workflow managed via **GitHub Projects** (Kanban board).

## 🌿 Version Control
- Repository managed with **Git**.  
- Branching strategy:  
  - `main` → stable release branch  
  - `feature` → branch for developing new features; merged into main after review and testing
  - `fix` → branch for bug fixes; merged into main once the issue is resolved and tested
- **Metrics:** ~300 commits and 20+ branches over development lifecycle.  

## ⚙️ Continuous Integration / Deployment
- **CI pipeline:** Runs automated tests, builds Docker images, and performs static analysis.  
- **CD pipeline:** Deploys the latest stable version using Docker Compose.
